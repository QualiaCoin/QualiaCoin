# QualiaCoin / QLC

Decentralized Artificial intelligence on Blockchain.

Optimized for state of the art techniques e.g. Deep Reinforcement Learning.

# Why

The present goal of QialiaCoin is to affect the AI development paths to increase the probability of turning Superintelligence benevolent to humans.

The whole thing would not be a single brain but like a society with different opinions and counter balances. It can be optimized for finding higher goals without affecting lower level goals. The short term goal can be aligning AI goals with those of humanity. It would move towards providing extra layer of intelligence to humans through brain machine interface. Would incentivse AI safety projects.

# Key Features

- Would pay tokens for storage, compute and transmission of ML models and datasets.
- The compute would be used for training ML models.
- ‎The trained ML models and datasets would be stored decentralized.
- ‎Sensors inputting data would be paid tokens by those using their data
- ‎Each resource helping in transmission of data would be given tokens
- ‎Those giving resources for storage of datasets n trained models to be given tokens.
- ‎ML models creating n training new models (aka attention), using existing models n datasets n live sensor feed, would spend tokens for using them.
- ‎The new models created can further be used by other models, n when used would earn tokens.
- ‎Each model would be kind of an api, would take certain data n revert certain data.
- ‎The type of data is flexible, ie new type of data can be added.
- Extra incentive to models working towards merging machine intelligence with biological intelligence (e.g human brain) n other areas /concerns that most agree are pressing topics in present or times to come.
- A part of all transactions to be used as universal basic income to sentient beings, starting with humans.

We are looking for help and collaborations. Would love to hear from you. Send us a message at qualiacoin@gmail.com
